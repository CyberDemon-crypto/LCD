### Usage
```
bash setup.sh  # It will install everything to work with almost all kinds of files
sudo bash LCD.sh  # It's easier to live with access to root folders
```
### P.S.
* It also works on phones, but there you can only deal with text files and folders
* To change the Starting directory - change last line
